### My Vim, Tmux and other config files

These are my dotfiles so they're easier to move around between machines 
(except my emacs config files that are [on another repository](https://github.com/juanjux/emacs-dotfiles)).

Currently this host my .vimrc, .tmux.conf, kitty.conf, .ideavimrc and a theme for IntelliJ-based IDEs (I
also have an [emacs version](https://github.com/juanjux/emacs-professional-theme) and a 
[vim version](https://github.com/juanjux/professional_jjux) 
elsewhere).
